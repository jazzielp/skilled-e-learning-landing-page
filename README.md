## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Web framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com//) - CSS framework
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) - Host

### What I learned

I learned Astro, which I thought was very good to create this landing page and continue practicing tailwind for CSS. The page has a detail with respect to the image that is at the top and it is because I did not know how to arrange it in the corner. If someone can help me with that, I would greatly appreciate it.

### Continued development

I continue learning these technologies since I want to specialize in them and at the same time be able to create more sites integrating more technologies
